</p>

NBA visualisation project for the Data Visualisation course of the MSc in Data Science at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM).

The dataset has been extracted from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) repository, originally collected from the [basketball-reference website](https://www.basketball-reference.com/). The data contains information on the individual records of the different players who played in the NBA between 2003 and 2020.

# Tasks
* Visualization of the time evolution of each player according to different records: points, assists, rebounds, blocks and steals.
* Relative position of a player in a certain aspect of the game in relation to the rest of the players in the competition.
* Comparison between two competitive players in a particular aspect of play.
* Clustering of players according to their playing style.

# How to use it
Download all the files contained in the repository and have an R interpreter installed. It is also possible to run the program as a [Shiny application](https://agouloumis.shinyapps.io/NBA-visualization/).
